# UTF-8-Converter
Tool to convert text files to UTF-8 Encoding.
"utf8-convert.sh" Allows you to input a text file you want to convert to UTF-8 and input the output file.
"utf8-directory-convert.sh" - Does the same thing as the regular convert, But you select a directory full of txt files you want to convert. This tool will automatically convert all of the txt files, and output them to a directory called "Converted" with the original file name.
